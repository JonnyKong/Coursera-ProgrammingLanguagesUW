;Write a function vector-assoc that takes a value v and a vector vec. It should behave like Racket's
;assoc library function except (1) it processes a vector (Racket's name for an array) instead of a list,
;(2) it allows vector elements not to be pairs in which case it skips them, and (3) it always takes exactly
;two arguments. Process the vector elements in order starting from 0. You must use library functions
;vector-length, vector-ref, and equal?. Return #f if no vector element is a pair with a car field
;equal to v, else return the first pair with an equal car field. Sample solution is 9 lines, using one local
;recursive helper function.

;Write a function cached-assoc that takes a list xs and a number n and returns a function that takes
;one argument v and returns the same thing that (assoc v xs) would return. However, you should
;use an n-element cache of recent results to possibly make this function faster than just calling assoc
;(if xs is long and a few elements are returned often). The cache must be a Racket vector of length n
;that is created by the call to cached-assoc (use Racket library function vector or make-vector) and
;used-and-possibly-mutated each time the function returned by cached-assoc is called. Assume n is
;positive.
;The cache starts empty (all elements #f). When the function returned by cached-assoc is called, it
;rst checks the cache for the answer. If it is not there, it uses assoc and xs to get the answer and if
;the result is not #f (i.e., xs has a pair that matches), it adds the pair to the cache before returning
;(using vector-set!). The cache slots are used in a round-robin fashion: the rst time a pair is added
;to the cache it is put in position 0, the next pair is put in position 1, etc. up to position n ô€€€ 1 and
;then back to position 0 (replacing the pair already there), then position 1, etc.
;Hints:
; In addition to a variable for holding the vector whose contents you mutate with vector-set!,
;use a second variable to keep track of which cache slot will be replaced next. After modifying the
;cache, increment this variable (with set!) or set it back to 0.
; To test your cache, it can be useful to add print expressions so you know when you are using the
;cache and when you are not. But remove these print expressions before submitting your code.
; Sample solution is 15 lines.
